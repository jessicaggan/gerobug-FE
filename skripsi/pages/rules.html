                    <p>We acknowledge your contribution and allow you to disclose or publish the vulnerabilities that
                        you have found. You can refer to the following disclosure policy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue that you report before
                            making any information about the report public or sharing such information with others.</li>
                        <li>You do not interact with an individual account (which includes modifying or accessing data
                            from the account) if the account owner has not consented to such actions.</li>
                        <li>You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others,
                            including (but not limited to) unauthorised access to or destruction of data, and
                            interruption or degradation of our services.</li>
                        <li>You are required to act in good-faith security research to prevent disruptions and produce
                            minimum to no impact for Tokopedia and other Tokopedia users.</li>
                        <li>You do not exploit a security issue that you discover for any reason. (This includes
                            demonstrating additional risk, such as attempted compromise of sensitive company data or
                            probing for additional issues.)</li>
                        <li>You do not intentionally violate any other applicable laws or regulations, including (but
                            not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorised access to data.</li>
                        <li>For the purposes of this policy, you are not authorised to access user data or company data,
                            including (but not limited to) personally identifiable information and data relating to an
                            identified or identifiable natural person, except as part of vulnerability validation.</li>
                        <li>If you want to publish the vulnerability you reporting, please give us reasonable time to
                            fix it and you can disclose it to the public after you receive approval from Tokopedia team
                            and at least 3 months after the vulnerability is fixed.</li>
                        <li>Tokopedia reserves the right to decide whether submitted reports are allowed to be published
                            to the public or not.</li>
                        <li>Reports with ‘critical’ severity are not allowed to be published solely by Researchers.</li>
                        <li>If you want to publish the report to the public, you are required to submit a disclosure
                            request via Tokopedia Bug Bounty portal and obtain written consent from Tokopedia, and wait
                            at least 3 months after the vulnerability is fixed.</li>
                        <li>If you publish reports without Tokopedia’s consent (for any reasons : education, popularity,
                            etc), we will not hesitate to initiate a lawsuit or take legal action against you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 id="2">Bounty Terms</h4>
                    <p>We recognise and reward security researchers who help us to keep Tokopedia’s system and data safe
                        by reporting vulnerabilities in our services. Monetary bounties for such reports are entirely at
                        Tokopedia's discretion, based on risk, impact and other factors. To potentially qualify for a
                        bounty, you first need to meet the following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are required to read and agree with Terms and Conditions on Tokopedia Bug Bounty portal
                            before submitting any reports.</li>
                        <li>You are not allowed to submit the report by contacting Tokopedia employees directly or
                            through other channels.</li>
                        <li>Adhere to our responsible disclosure policy (see above).</li>
                        <li>Report a security bug: identify a vulnerability in our services or infrastructure which
                            creates a security or privacy risk. (Note that Tokopedia reserves the right to determine the
                            risk of an issue or bug in the report, as not all software bugs are security issues and have
                            security or privacy risk.)</li>
                        <li>Your report must describe a problem involving one of the products or services listed below
                            (See "In Scope" and “Out Scope”).</li>
                        <li>We specifically exclude certain types of potential security issues; these are listed below
                            (See "In Scope" and “Out Scope”).</li>
                        <li>Submit your report via our "Report a security vulnerability" form (one issue per report) and
                            respond to the report with any updates. Please do not contact employees directly or through
                            other channels to submit a report.</li>
                        <li>If you inadvertently cause a privacy violation or disruption (such as accessing account
                            data, service configurations or other confidential information) while investigating an
                            issue, you must disclose this in your report.</li>
                        <li>Use test accounts when investigating issues. If you cannot reproduce an issue with a test
                            account, you can use a real account (except for automated testing). Do not interact with
                            other accounts without consent. In turn, we will follow these guidelines when evaluating
                            reports under our bug bounty program.</li>
                        <li>We investigate and respond to all valid reports. Due to the volume of reports that we
                            receive, however, we prioritise evaluations based on risk and other factors. Tokopedia will
                            provide responses and initial acknowledgement to the submitted Bug Bounty Report, maximum,
                            in 3 (three) Working Days.</li>
                        <li>In determining the issue severity, Tokopedia is using the Common Vulnerability Scoring
                            System (CVSS) calculator along with risk-based approach analysis.</li>
                        <li>We determine bounty amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to)
                            impact, ease of exploitation and quality of the report.</li>
                        <li>We aim to pay similar amounts for similar issues, but bounty amounts and qualifying issues
                            may change over time. Past rewards do not necessarily guarantee similar amounts of rewards
                            in the future.</li>
                        <li>In the event of duplicate reports, reward will be awarded to the first researcher who
                            submitted a valid Bug Bounty Report based on Tokopedia analysis and discretion.(Tokopedia
                            reserves the right to determine whether a Bug Bounty Report is a duplicate, and Tokopedia is
                            not required to disclose the details of the Bug Bounty Report.) A given bounty is only paid
                            to one individual.</li>

                    <p>A: We expect that vulnerability reports sent to us have a valid attack scenario to qualify for a
                        reward, and we consider it as a critical step when doing vulnerability research. Reward amounts
                        are decided based on the maximum impact of the vulnerability, and the panel is willing to
                        reconsider a reward amount, based on new information (such as a chain of bugs, or a revised
                        attack scenario).</p>
